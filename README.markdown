## Overview

This module manages Kibana for use with Elasticsearch.

## Module Description

In addition to managing the Kibana system package and service, this module also
exposes options to control the configuration file for Kibana.
Kibana plugins are also supported via a native type and provider.

Dependencies are fairly standard (stdlib and apt for Debian-based
distributions).

## Setup

### What Kibana affects

* The `kibana` system package and service
* `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`
* `/usr/share/kibana/plugins/*`

### Setup Requirements

In addition to basic puppet settings (such as pluginsync), ensure that the
required dependencies for the module are met (these are listed in
`metadata.json` and listed in the Puppet Forge). 

### Beginning with kibana

Quick start:

```puppet
class { 'kibana' : }
```

## Usage

In order to control Kibana's configuration file, use the `config` parameter:

```puppet
class { 'kibana':
  config => {
    'server.port' => '8080',
  }
}
```

The `kibana` class also supports additional values for the `ensure` parameter
that will be passed along to the `package` resource for Kibana.
For example, to ensure the latest version of Kibana is always installed:

```puppet
class { 'kibana': ensure => latest }
```

In order to explicitly ensure that version 5.2.0 of Kibana is installed:

```puppet
class { 'kibana': ensure => '5.2.0' }
```

The `kibana` class also supports removal through use of `ensure => absent`:

```puppet
class { 'kibana': ensure => absent }
```

### Plugins

Kibana plugins can be managed by this module.
In the most basic form, official plugins (provided by Elastic) can simply be
specified by name alone:

```puppet
kibana_plugin { 'x-pack': }
```

The type also supports installing third-party plugins from a remote URL:

```puppet
kibana_plugin { 'health_metric_vis':
  url => 'https://github.com/DeanF/health_metric_vis/releases/download/v0.3.4/health_metric_vis-5.2.0.zip',
}
```

When updating plugins, it is important to specify the version of the plugin
that should be installed.
For example, the preceding block of code installed version 0.3.4 of the
`health_metric_vis` plugin. In order to update that plugin to version 0.3.5,
you could use a resource such as the following:

```puppet
kibana_plugin { 'health_metric_vis':
  url => 'https://github.com/DeanF/health_metric_vis/releases/download/v0.3.5/health_metric_vis-5.2.0.zip',
  version => '0.3.5',
}
```

Plugins can also be removed:

```puppet
kibana_plugin { 'x-pack': ensure => absent }
```

## Reference

Class parameters are available in [the auto-generated documentation
pages](https://elastic.github.io/puppet-kibana/puppet_classes/kibana.html).
Autogenerated documentation for types, providers, and ruby helpers is also
available on the same documentation site.

## Limitations

This module is actively tested against the versions and distributions listed in
`metadata.json`.

## Development

See CONTRIBUTING.md with help to get started.
